## Inspiration
Our inspiration was Wolfram Alpha, because it acts a very powerful and useful multi-tool for the world of Mathematics. We decided to create a similar, useful multi-tool for the world of Finance. We thought this would be a good approach to cover a range of topics and provide Financial accessibility.

## What it does
Provides incredibly useful and easily understandable tools to show the importance of budgeting, saving, investing and choosing the correct financial strategies.

## How we built it
We built this web application using EJS and ExpressJS. We used Github for version control, and paper and google docs to plan our ideas.

## Challenges we ran into
Our original idea was a little too ambitious so we decided to regroup and change our plan. We are pleased with our decision as we think we have created an even more powerful, useful and accessible tool.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We stayed the full 24 hours for the first time! And we have submitted what we would consider a complete product, with room for extending its capabilities.

## What we learned
We have learned that next time we should bring sleeping bags and mats, and actually try and sleep a little, because we feel like zombies.

## What's next for Bask.it
We would like to delve more into teaching the advanced financial strategies and advice used by big investment managers, using our web app.
